                            My name is Jaclane Felix, but I go by Jackie. I'm an extroverted introvert is that makes sense. I tend to be very quiet and observant, but I'm not afraid to voice my opinions. I have a daughter who's a year and a half now, and she is my pride and joy. 
                            I got through a year of college (I majored in Kinesiology) before I got pregant and dropped out afterwards. I've spent the past couple of years working different jobs on and off, but nothing too crazy.
                            I realised quickly though, that I needed to find a new path for myself because I was not living the quality of life I had always envisioned for myself as well as the family I've started to build.
